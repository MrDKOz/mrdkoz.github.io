title: Why Span<T> is your friend...

I recently gave a [lightning talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) at [Redgate](https://github.com/red-gate) about `Span<T>` and why more people should know about it, and maybe even think about using it when appropriate. I thought it'd also make for a good write-up here.

### What is `Span<T>`?
`Span<T>` allows you access to a section of contiguous memory (stack, heap, or even unmanaged), and gives you the ability to work with that section of memory whilst remaining in stack memory.

Whilst there are many ways of utilising span (some good examples can be found [here](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Farchive%2Fmsdn-magazine%2F2018%2Fjanuary%2Fcsharp-all-about-span-exploring-a-new-net-mainstay)), this article will focus on `ReadOnlySpan<T>`.

### What does it do?
I think a visual aid is better than anything I could ever write out here, so here's a gif and a step-by-step

![Span T Demo](/images/span-t-slow.gif)

 1. We have a string with the value of "OSBO44", which creates an entry in our heap memory, and a pointer to that memory allocation on our stack
 2. We then cast the pointer to a type of `ReadOnlySpan<char>`, this then creates 3 entries in the stack (pointer, offset, and length)
 3. We then pull out a substring from "OSBO44" using the `Slice` function - this only updates the offset of the span and nothing else
 4. We can then parse and return the 44, all without entering the heap!

### What are the downsides?
`Span<T>` does have some limitations, these are all to ensure that we stay out of heap memory and within the stack, `Span<T>` cannot be used in the following ways:

 - used as a field in a class
 - used across `await` and `yield` boundaries
 - boxed
 - assigned to Object/dynamic variables (or to any other interface type)

### So why should I use it?
I'll let the results speak for itself, these statistics were generated using [BenchmarkDotNet](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet) from this we can easily see from here that when we use `Span<T>` considerably less memory is allocated during its run, and when only processing a single string we don't allocate any additional memory at all! We also get a notable performance increase for free.

So we have the following function, this fetches each country code out of each item in an array of strings using `.Substring()`:
```
private readonly string[] _accountIds = { "OSBO44", "SMITH01", "CONL353", "POPE379", "KIMJ850" };
public int[] FetchAllCountryCodesUsingSubstring()
{
    var countryIds = new int[_accountIds.Length];
    for (var i = 0; i < countryIds.Length; i++)
    {
        var accountId = _accountIds[i];
        countryIds[i] = int.Parse(accountId[4..]);
    }

    return countryIds;
}
```
and then we have the same function, but this time we're using Span to store the string, and then using Slice to get our substring:
```
public int[] FetchAllCountryCodesUsingSpan()
{
    var countryIds = new int[_accountIds.Length];
    for (var i = 0; i < _accountIds.Length; i++)
    {
        ReadOnlySpan<char> accountIdAsSpan = _accountIds[i];
        countryIds[i] = int.Parse(accountIdAsSpan[4..]);
    }

    return countryIds;
}
```
So whilst these two functions return the same substring, there are some memory and performance gains to be had.

From the results above, you can see the results for the two functions above. Using the span method results in us allocating a lot less memory, than its substring counterpart!

### The proof is in the code
Don't just take my word for it though, you can download the project I built for testing this from my GitHub ([repository](https://github.com/MrDKOz/SpanEfficiency)).

Hope you learnt something!
