title: Why Span<T> is your friend...

I recently gave a [lightning talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) at [Redgate](https://github.com/red-gate) about `Span<T>` and why more people should know about it, and maybe even think about using it when appropriate. I thought it'd also make for a good write-up here.

### What is `Span<T>`?
`Span<T>` allows you access to a section of contiguous memory (stack, heap, or even unmanaged), and gives you the ability to work with that section of memory on the stack. Whilst there are many different ways of utilising span, this post will focus on `ReadOnlySpan<T>`.

### What are the downsides?
`Span<T>` does has some limitations, some of which are as follows:

 - Cannot be...
	 - used as a field in a class
	 - used across `await` and `yield` boundaries
	 - boxed
	 - assigned to Object/dynamic variables (or to any other interface type)
 - These are all to ensure that we stay out of heap memory, and remain on the stack

### What does it do?
I think a visual aid is better than anything I could ever write out here, so here's a gif and a step-by-step

 1. We have a string with the value of "OSBO44", which creates an entry in our heap memory, and a pointer to that memory allocation on our stack
 2. We then cast the pointer to a type of `ReadOnlySpan<char>`, this then creates 2 entries in the stack (pointer, offset, and length)
 3. We then pull out a substring from "OSBO44" using the `Slice` function - this only updates the offset of the span and nothing else
 4. We can then parse and return the 44, all without entering the heap!

### So why should I use it?
I'll let the results speak for itself, these statistics were generated using [BenchmarkDotNet](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet) from this we can easily see from here that when we use `Span<T>` considerably less memory is allocated during its run, and when only processing a single string we don't allocate any additional memory at all! We also get a notable performance increase for free.

### The proof is in the code
Don't just take my word for it though, you can download the project I built for testing this from my GitHub ([repository](https://github.com/MrDKOz/SpanEfficiency)).

Hope you learnt something!
