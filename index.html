<p>Welcome to my site in progress, my name is Daniel Osborne (if you didn't already see the header), and I am a Software Developer and Tinkerer living in the U.K.</p>

<p>This corner of the internet will contain my thoughts, ramblings, and write-ups of various projects both the benefit of future me, and also for anyone else interested.</p>

<p>Have a look around, maybe (once I have some content), you'll see something that piques your interest.</p>
