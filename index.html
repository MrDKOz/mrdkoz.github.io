<p>Welcome, my name is Daniel Osborne, I currently live in in the UK, by day I work for <a href="https://red-gate.com">Redgate</a> and by night I'm a tinkerer of things, and always looking to learn something new!</p>

<p>This corner of the internet will contain my thoughts, ramblings, and write-ups of various projects both the benefit of future me, and also for anyone else interested.</p>

<p>Have a look around and maybe you'll see something that piques your interest, or hopefully something you can learn from.</p>
