Hi, my name is Daniel Osborne, I'm a self-taught professional developer and tinkerer from the U.K.

I started experimenting with Batch files, moved up to VB Scripts, until I purchased my first book "[Microsoft® Visual C#® 2008 Express Edition: Build a Program Now!](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Microsoft%C2%AE-Visual-2008-Express-PRO-Developer/dp/0735625425)" which threw me into the .NET ecosystem. After working on various projects in my personal time, I got the chance to cut my teeth in Delphi at my first place of work, over years of doing the odd project here and there, I eventually landed my first professional development job and I haven't looked back!

This site is really 2-fold, on one hand, it's a place for me to keep my notes so I can look back on them if I need to look something up, and on the other hand maybe someone will find something I've written helpful.
